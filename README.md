# QRNet

A simple neural network that predicts the first character that is stored in a [QR-code](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR-Code)  
such as this:

![Sample QR-code](./files/00bLF6qvQF.png)

At training time, 
QR codes are created randomly from alphanumeric strings of length ten (`00bLF6qvQF` in the example above).  
The validation set also contains *5000* randomly generated QR codes [1].

To install qrcode
``` bash
$ pip install qrcode
```

## Training

To start the training, simply call:
``` bash
$ python train.py
```

Then, you can run `tensorboard` to view the test-set accuracy:
``` bash
$ tensorboard --logdir /tmp/qrnet-log --reload_interval 5
```

## Results

After approximately *50.000* iterations (with *200* QR codes per batch), it
reaches a test-set accuracy of over *0.999*.

## Footnotes

[1] Note that there are *(2 × 26 + 10)^10 ≈ 10^18* possible QR codes,  
so chances of collisions between the training and the test set are vanishingly small.

[2] Unfortunately, the online training is rather slow.  
Most of the time is actually spent in the (parallelized) QR code generation.
